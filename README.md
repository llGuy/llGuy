## Video games and engines

I really enjoy working on video games and engines.

The project I am working on the most at the moment is vkPhysics - the engine + game. I
write articles on certain parts of the engine which I found a bit tricky to get working,
notably the networking part to get real-time multiplayer support in a world that
is completely deformable (you can find them here: https://llguy.github.io/).
